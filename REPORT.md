## Answers to Questions

### 1. Required Stats on Operations

#### 1.1 Completed Trips per Country
| Country | Completed Trips |
|---------|----------------|
| FR      | 6,126         |
| EN      | 5,598         |
| DE      | 2,051         |

##### Interpretation:
- **France (FR)**: With 6126 completed trips, France is the country where the transport service is most used.
- **England (EN)**: 5598 completed trips, making it the second-largest market.
- **Germany (DE)**: 2051 completed trips, representing the smallest market among the three analyzed countries.

These results show strong adoption of the service in France and England, while Germany has a lower volume of activity.

#### 1.2 Average User Activity
| Avg Searches | Avg Bookings | Avg Completed Trips |
|--------------|--------------|---------------------|
| 3.75 | 1.19 | 0.75 |

##### Interpretation:
- On average, users perform 3.75 searches before making a booking
- The conversion from searches to bookings is approximately 32% (1.19/3.75)
- About 63% of bookings result in completed trips (0.75/1.19)
- The overall funnel shows a natural drop from search to completion, with users needing multiple searches to convert to a single booking
- Each user completes 0.75 trips on average, indicating that some users are occasional riders while others might be regular users

| gcc_north_costwolds | EN | 8,049 | 1,497 | 793 | 9.85% |

**Data Quality Note**: Several territories show identical metrics (same number of searches, bookings, and completed trips), which might indicate either paired territories across countries or potential data quality issues that should be investigated.

#### 2.2 Booking Channels Distribution
| Channel | Total Bookings | Percentage |
|---------|----------------|------------|
| BOOKED_FROM_APP | 6,320 | 45.88% |
| BOOKED_FROM_WEBSITE | 4,187 | 30.40% |
| BOOKED_FROM_CALL_CENTER | 2,878 | 20.89% |
| BOOKED_FROM_DRIVER_APP | 390 | 2.83% |

**Interpretation**:
- Mobile app is the dominant booking channel, accounting for nearly half (45.88%) of all completed trips
- Digital channels (app + website) represent over 76% of bookings, showing strong digital adoption
- Call center remains a significant channel (20.89%), suggesting the importance of maintaining human support
- Driver app bookings are minimal (2.83%), possibly reserved for specific use cases or emergency situations
- The distribution suggests a well-balanced multi-channel strategy with a clear digital-first approach

### 3. Optional Advanced Analysis

#### 3.1 Cancellation Patterns Across Territories (Top 5)
| Territory | Country | Total Bookings | Cancelled Bookings | Cancellation Rate |
|-----------|---------|----------------|-------------------|------------------|

| DE | 21 | 427 | 17.86% |

#### 3.3 Additional Data Insights
1. **Cross-Country Patterns**
   - Each country shows distinct booking channel preferences
   - High cancellation rates (>25%) are common across all countries
   - Evening hours (19-21) are peak booking times

2. **Data Quality Notes**
   - Some territories show identical metrics, suggesting possible data issues
   - Consistent patterns in peak hours across countries
   - Clear differences in channel preferences by country

## Additional Insights

1. **Conversion Patterns**
   - France shows the highest engagement and conversion rates
   - England has the largest user base but moderate conversion
   - Germany shows lower engagement across all metrics

2. **User Behavior**
   - French users are more likely to complete their bookings
   - English users show good initial interest but lower conversion
   - German market might need investigation for low engagement

## Assumptions Made

1. A trip is considered completed when:
   - `passenger_status = 'DROPOFF'`
   - `status = 'VALIDATED'`

2. User uniqueness:
   - Users are unique per product
   - Used combination of user_id and product_slug for unique identification

3. Data quality:
   - All timestamps are in the same timezone
   - No duplicate entries in raw data 

## Technical Implementation Details

1. **Data Pipeline Structure**
   - Raw Layer: Direct views on parquet files
   - Prepared Layer: Cleaned and joined data models
   - Reporting Layer: Aggregated metrics and KPIs

2. **Performance Considerations**
   - Used appropriate indexes through DuckDB
   - Minimized redundant joins
   - Implemented efficient aggregations

## Potential Improvements

With more time, I would:
1. Add data quality checks
2. Implement time-based analyses (daily/weekly trends)
3. Add booking channel analysis
4. Create territory-level conversion funnels
5. Add documentation directly in SQL using comments

## Data Quality Notes

1. **Completeness**
   - All countries have data representation
   - No missing values in key identifier fields

2. **Consistency**
   - Booking statuses are standardized
   - Territory mapping is consistent across products

## Future Recommendations

1. **Monitoring Suggestions**
   - Track conversion rates over time
   - Monitor booking completion rates by territory
   - Set up alerts for unusual drops in engagement

2. **Analysis Extensions**
   - Add peak hours analysis
   - Implement cohort analysis
   - Add seasonal trend analysis
